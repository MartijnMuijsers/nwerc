Printing a double in a specific format can be done with DecimalFormat:
	DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(“#.00”);
where “#” means: I don’t care how many digits,
and “0” means: exactly this many digits.

“#.00” will print 384.29342 as 384.29
“#.##” will print 384.29342 as 384.29
“#.00” will print 5.1 as 5.10
“#.##” will print 5.1 as 5.1
“#.00” will print 0.7 as .70
“#.##” will print 0.7 as .7

For custom rounding, use
	df.setRoundingMode(RoundingMode);
